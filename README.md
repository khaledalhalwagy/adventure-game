# adventure-game
Designed and implemented a text-based adventure game in Python as my graduation project. I extended the original assignment with multiple imagination-driven features: procedurally selected monsters (sourced from encyclopedic lists), a dynamic victory-text generator, a points-based progression and branching combat choices, a final riddle challenge.
